Today is [Software Freedom Day][sfd], one day each year set aside to celebrate
[Free Software][freesw] and its importance in building a free society. We should
spend today informing others and encouraging them to reject non-free proprietary
programs in favor of free programs. So, for the uninitiated, let me explain just
what this means, and why you should care.

> "Free software" means software that respects users' freedom and community.
  Roughly, **the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change
  and improve the software**. With these freedoms, the users (both individually
  and collectively) control the program and what it does for them.

> &ndash; excerpt from [What is free software?][freesw]

I think this sums it up quite well; freedom is important in every aspect of our
lives, and with our ever-growing immersion into technology it is important for
us to remember that. That seems pretty dramatic- so to lighten the tone a bit,
let me give a few situations where having freedom actually makes a direct impact
on our lives.

##### What do you think of the new iOS update?
Well, let's hope you like it. If not... what is there to do? Go begging to Apple
to make the transition animations snappier? Pray that those lock-screen
vulnerabilities are fixed soon so that strangers can't [access your personal data][iosbug1]
or [make calls from your locked device][iosbug2]?

These are real problems, and while they might not be deal-breakers for the
average Joe, it illustrates one of the advantages of being in control of your
computing. When there is something wrong or that you just don't like about a
closed platform, you can either take it or leave it. Given the same
circumstances, but with a free operating system (such as Mozilla's [Firefox OS][fxos]),
you (or someone else in the community) can fix or modify the software, make
a new build and share this fix with the world (and with Mozilla, so they can
use it in the next release).

##### How much can you trust a proprietary Operating System?
Lots of people depend on proprietary Operating Systems for their daily computing,
but how much trust should you really place in Microsoft or Apple? Is it possible
that Microsoft is spying on your activities? Can you prove the aren't?

This may sound like paranoia- you'd think you would hear something about it if
they did that. Well... how? Without the ability to study the source code, no one
(outside of Microsoft) can easily say what is happening under the hood. However,
through some clever observation, researchers were able to discover that Windows
XP was [sending home a list of installed programs][winxp] on a user's machine
each time it requested an update from Microsoft. Although with Windows 8, now
you might voluntarily tell Microsoft everything you install from their app
store anyway!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The point is this: you deserve software you can trust- software that doesn't
abuse your freedoms for someone else's gain. This is why I urge you to consider
switching your Operating System to a [Free GNU/Linux Distribution][fsflist] such
as [Trisquel GNU/Linux][trisquel]. If you're not ready to make the switch just
yet, you can get started by installing some free alternatives to popular non-free
programs, which you can run on Windows or Mac. I'd personally recommend using
[Firefox][firefox] as your web browser, [LibreOffice][libreof] over Microsoft
Office, [Thunderbird][tbird] for email and [Pidgin][pidgin] for messaging.

I hope you will join me in supporting freedom!  Happy [Software Freedom Day][sfd]!
