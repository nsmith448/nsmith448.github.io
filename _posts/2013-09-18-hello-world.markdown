Here it is, my blog: some obscure space in the internet where I can discuss all
things that are mucking about both inside my head and on my filesystem. I've
landed on [Github Pages][gh-pages] as the ideal hosting solution, the result of
months of unproductive exploration. One of the advantags of hosting on [Github][gh-home]
is that all the content you're seeing is statically generated by [Jekyll][jekyll],
a free software project to build blog-aware static sites. This is quite different
from my original idea of building a blog from scratch using [node.js][nodejs] and
[MongoDB][mongo] as a simple backend for an [AngularJS][angular] application.

Wait a second...

If you've been following along you'll have likely noticed the dramatic shift
I've made from dynamic, rich javascript front-end application to static,
minimalistic HTML. Short answer- It didn't work out. After spending some time
working with node and angular I quickly realized that this is a job suited for
neither of these two.

Node has been fun to play around with, but its strengths
are geared more toward creating a powerful data-processing backend, which I just
didn't need. And although [Angular][angular] is really cool to learn and work with,
it just _isn't necessary_ for a blog to have this. I'd much rather have my blog be
accessible, crawlable and simplistic than force some unwanted "Web 2.0" down
your throats for my own amusement.

And with that, I finally have a blog online.

Thanks, [Github Pages][gh-pages].
