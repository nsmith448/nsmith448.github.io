Today marks 30 years since Richard Stallman first announced his intention to
code the world's first free Operating System.

I have been reading about him lately in [the novel][thebook] by Sam Williams and
Richard Stallman, ["Free as in Freedom (2.0)"][thebook], which elegantly captures
Stallman's early life and involvement in the Free Software Movement. This is
version 2.0 because it has been edited by Stallman himself to correct and update
a few things that he disagreed with, and to add his usual wit.

> Free Unix!

> Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete
Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnu's Not Unix), and
give it away free to everyone who can use it.

So, happy birthday to GNU! There are a ton of festivities going on this weekend
including a [hackathon][hackgnu] in Cambridge (although I'll be attending a
[different hackathon][hackny] this weekend) and much more. Also, Stephen Fry
made a nice ["Happy Birthday to GNU"][fry] video to show his appreciation for
freedom! That's awesome.
